# This Makefile is used to run custom scripts in the current repository. It allows the user to list and interactively select
# a script to run.
#
# The scripts are in the 'scripts' directory. Files inside a 'lib' directory are not considered scripts to run. So the user
# can place common modules in 'lib/' directories inside the 'scripts/' directory.
#
# To run a script, use the `run` target. The less friendly examples is the following:
#
# ```shell
# make -C path/to/this/directory WORKING_DIR=$(pwd) run
# ```
#
# You can also create an alias to run the script. Example:
#
# ```shell
# alias custom_script='make -C path/to/this/directory WORKING_DIR=$(pwd)'
#
# custom_script run
# ````
#
# To list the scripts, use the `ls` target. You can also open a shell in the scripts base directory with the `cd` target

# Run the specified script in the specified working directory
#
# The user need to provide to environment variable:
#
# - SCRIPT: The name of the script to run
# - WORKING_DIR: The working directory in which the script will be run
#
# If the user does not provide the script, this target will be prompted interactively with 'fzf' to select it. But this scripts
# will not prompt the user to provide the working directory. If not provided, the target will use the directory of the Makefile.
#
# After the script is run, this target will show a command that user can use to automatically run the selected script again
